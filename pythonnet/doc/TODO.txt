TODO list
=========

For PythonNet 2.0 
-----------------

 * Implement support for ModulePropertyAttribute.

 * Replace CLRModule.preload code with ModulePropertyAttribute specific code.
 
 * Deprecate implicit loading of assemblies

 * Debug failing unit tests under Mono and report them if they are caused
   by incompatibilities in Mono. 

Future and nice-to-have features
--------------------------------

 * Add support for Python's debug builds. Debug builds have additional fields
   in the struct, extensive self testing and C assert() are enabled. Py_DEBUG
   implies Py_TRACE_REFS and Py_REF_DEBUG which enlarge the PyObject and 
   PyVarObject based structs. The Py_INCREF and Py_DECREF macros have a larger
   payload as well. They keep track of the absolute number of references and
   do tests when an object is GCed. 
   I've taken care of most of the incompatibilities but the Py_DEBUG build 
   is still broken. Somehow tp_mro of wrapper_descriptor isn't a tuple.

 * Support Python 2.6. The most important feature I was able to isolate is the
   PyType_FastSubclass macro and related TypeFlags in interops.cs.

 * Let's talk to the Debian and Ubuntu maintainers for Python in order to convince
   them to build Python with --enable-shared. Ubuntu's Python is semi static and not
   linked against libpython2.x.so. This causes trouble with clr.so.
